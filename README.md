<p>This is Tab Cloaking, which all the people who make game websites use to make it look like you are on google, gmail, google classroom, etc. People usually make the code look really complex, but this is the narrowed down form of it. This is very simple and you can use it on your website with permission from me by asking me on my discord.(sans902#4875)</p>
